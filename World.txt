**NOTES**
* This text document is subject to change just as much as the code is, so we will need to keep a notes section for the header here as well.
* We can denote the currentRoom with the '[' and ']' brackets. Each room has to have all four directions filled, and any direction that is
* filled with NONE means that the player will not be able to choose that direction while in that room.
